# :cloud: Backend Temara

After downloading all resources above, you have to install all dependencies with this command below in your terminal:<br />**`npm install`**

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Start Server

In the resources above, I'am using nodemon to run the server. If you want to run the server, execute this command below in your terminal:<br />**`npm start`**.<br /><br />
if you don't want to use nodemon for run the server, you can change the configuration in package.json.
