# Backend Temara

After downloading all resources above, you have to install all dependencies with this command in your terminal: **`npm install`**

## Start Server

In the resources above, I'am using nodemon to run the server. If you want to run the server, execute this command in your terminal: **`npm start`**
and if you don't want to use nodemon for run the server, you can change the configuration in package.json.
